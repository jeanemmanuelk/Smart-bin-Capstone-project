# Smart-bin-Capstone-project

Welcome to the Smart Bin Capstone Project! This project aims to create an efficient bin monitoring system that allows users to accurately track the status of one or more bins. By utilizing a combination of sensors and an ESP32 device, which can be easily programmed using the Arduino IDE, the system provides real-time data to an online server. This data is then displayed on a synchronized website for convenient access.

The primary objective of this project is to enable users to determine whether their bins are full or empty, as well as to gauge the level of fullness. This information empowers users to make informed decisions regarding waste management and disposal. With the potential for scalability, the system can be expanded to monitor multiple bins simultaneously, making it an ideal solution for larger-scale applications such as monitoring sets of recycle bins or trash bins.

By implementing the Smart Bin Capstone Project, several benefits can be achieved. Firstly, it reduces the need for frequent manual checks or pickups, resulting in significant cost savings. Bins can now be emptied precisely when necessary, optimizing waste collection operations. Additionally, this system promotes environmentally responsible practices by preventing premature bin emptying, ensuring that resources are utilized efficiently.

We are excited to embark on this journey of creating a smart and sustainable waste management solution. Join us as we revolutionize the way bins are monitored and contribute to a cleaner and greener future.

Feel free to explore the project's code and documentation to understand its inner workings and how you can adapt it to your specific needs. We encourage collaboration and welcome any feedback or suggestions for further enhancements.

Let's make a positive impact together with the Smart Bin Capstone Project!
