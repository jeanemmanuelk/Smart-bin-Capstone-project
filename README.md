# Smart-bin-Capstone-project
code for my capstone project

this is my bin sensor capstone project.

This project is about creating a system of bin sensor monitoring in order to monitor the state of one or more bins. For instance, using the system, the user is able to see and know whether or not their bin is full or empty and also how full or empty the bin is. The system uses a combination of two different sensors alongside with an ESP 32 device which allows to be programmed (using the Arduino IDE) and send data to an online server, which data are displayed on a website synchronously. This system could be improved and use with multiple bins to monitor them. On a bigger scale, for example, it can be used to determined if a set of bins(recycle bins or trash bins) is ready to be emptied so it reduces the expenses of checking or picking up the trash frequently in a sense where the trash can be picked only when full.
